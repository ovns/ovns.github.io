OVNi stands for Open Value Network infrastructure. 

**Working definition** of *infrastructure* - a coherent set of tools and processes which support the healthy function of a beneficial system. The infrastructure integrates everything from supply chain to distribution and customer relationships management. 
  
# Development 
## Spaces
We are developing a framework for resource management, value accounting and project management on [Value Network on Github](http://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork). See an evolving prototype [here](http://valnet.webfactional.com/). 

After the spring of 2014, a new group was formed mostly based in Europe to work on a OVN infrastructure based on semantic web and linked data. See [http://labs.ouishare.net/projects/opennetworks OuiShare labs/Value Networks]

NEWS: After the summer of 2014 a new initiative between OVN developers and Enspiral started to work on a the third generation of the NRO-VAS. See [OVN Sample Data on Github](https://github.com/openvocab/ovn/wiki/OVN-Sample-Data)


Known users of parts of OVNi
* [SENSORICA](http://www.sensorica.co) is a living lab for this model.
* [Guerilla Translation](http://guerrillatranslation.com/) adopted VAS.

# Theory
The [[value network]] is modeled as a living system. Infrastructure design is adjusted for optimal performance of the individual [[value network]] in terms of creativity, productivity, synchronicity, quality assurance, responsiveness, adaptability...and any other explicit objectives. The [[value network]] must also respond to ethical requirements (see the [[Ethos]] page).  

## Maps of the Infrastructure 
* [http://metamaps.cc/maps/468 latest map on the general layout (high level)]
* [http://metamaps.cc/maps/435 remap the infrastructure on metamaps.cc]
* [an alternative map of the infrastructure](http://metamaps.cc/maps/439)
* [OVN Protocols Conversation](http://metamaps.cc/maps/437)
* Bob's [- OVN-OS architecture layout](http://metamaps.cc/maps/442) for an open value network node
* Bob's [- OVN-OS internetworking protocol](http://metamaps.cc/maps/437), for network to network interaction

## Requirements
* [[Network of Networks]]
See SENSORICA's development of the [Open Alliance](http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/labonline-network/montreal-labonline/project-vie/the-open-alliance), which is a growing integrated and fractal open value network to which we apply the idea of networks of networks. 

### List of modules
NOTE: The following tree representation is inadequate. Think of it as a list. All the components are mapped more precisely in the Maps above. 

{March 25th, 2014} Bob has proposed the *Stop and Rethink* initiative on VAS. [Open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKyn84Rz4YYJe1USRWnu73A4rV3BIKBfXZt0WuOK8jk/edit#heading=h.9aj4y11z1knd) {delete after initiative ends}
