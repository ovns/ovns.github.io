The Nondominium framework is a property regime that allows participants to pool
resources by transferring ownership of their contributions to a Custodian in return for rights
of use, usufruct, revenue and decision making over the entire resource pool in proportion to
their relative contribution to the resource pool and its subsequent development (value
contributed and value potential). Membership in a Nondominium is open to anyone willing
to sign the Nondominium Agreement and signing the Nondominium Agreement does not
obligate the member to contribute. The Nondominium Agreement made up of a Charter, a
Value Equation (VE) and Governance Equation (GE).

Once resources are registered in a Nondominium, all value added to them, created by
using them, or resulting from their use, must be registered with the Nondominium or an
appropriate exchange value (payment) provided. Any exchange value (revenue) generated
is collected by the Custodian for distribution to the members according to the Value
Equation.

The ownership rights granted to members are not divisible, transferable or tradable by the
member. Rights may be subject to a global decay function that erodes rights over a set
time period. This decay may be tuned to provide transfer of control over time to current
stewards and prevent long term capture by inactive members.

The permission to register further resources or value added may be withdrawn at any time
through the proper exercise of governance rights granted by the Governance Equation.
Note that the excluded party is still a member of the Nondominium and continues to
participate in the revenue and other forms of reward from their proportionate contributions
up to the time of exclusion. Rights of Governance are withdrawn through a sanction
dimension on the governance equation that may have a decay function attached to it
(*forgiveness), or that may decay naturally as governance related rights are earned by the
past contributions of the member.

The Nondominium Agreement may only be changed by unanimous consent of the
members, and the Value and Governance Equations may not be changed retroactively (i.e.
they can only changed to apply to contributions on a go­forward basis). The Nondominium
may be forked at any time by any subset of the membership (see Forking a Nondominium,
below).

Dissolution of a Nondominium must be altruistic. Assets may not be divided among
members but must be gifted to an equivalently or more permissive (equivalently or less
private) ownership structure, as appropriate to the nature of the asset (i.e. converted to a
Commons, open sourced, or donated to charity). Dissolution is subject to unanimous
consent of the members.

Charter
-------

The Charter for Nondominium is a statement of purpose, principals, mission, vision, goals
and objectives to which the actions and decisions of members can be linked.
The overarching purpose of a Nondominium is to develop a resource to the benefit of the
members of the Nondominium and reward them in proportion to their contribution. There is
no requirement to maximize such benefit, but rather sufficiency and sustainability are the
goals.

In contrast with the for­profit firm the overarching purpose of Nondominium is not to
maximize shareholder value but rather to optimize value created without creating or utilizing
negative externalities. In contrast with the not­for­profit charitable form the purpose is not to
maximize societal benefit while avoiding commercial activities (though for a specific
Nondominium this may be the mission). In contrast with for­benefit corporation the fiduciary
duty is not to maximize a specific societal benefit while being economically self sufficient,
(though for a specific Nondominium this may be the mission). In contrast with government,
the goal is not to create public good, but rather to create good for the members without
reducing it for non­members.

Value Equation
--------------

The Value Equation is a mechanism for Contributory Value Accounting. Rather than focus
solely on the exchange value of outputs as determined in a market, this approach focuses
on measuring and tracking contributions of value in its variety of forms. More importantly
the value equation goes beyond the tracking of contributions leading to a positive market
exchange (ie value chains, results only workplaces) and looks at tracking the activities that
lead to the probability of a value chain being created in the first place. This is a blend of
venture capital and market systems without the barriers and gatekeepers. By rewarding
more than the successful value chain, the value equation can be used to provide solidarity
mechanisms. Specifically it can recognize supportive ecosystem efforts that do not
succeed and are not directly linked to a successful value chain, in an ecosystem that
produces success along with exploratory failures. Using the parameters available a Value
Equation can be tuned to reward success and failures in a given ratio to promote more or
less exploratory work.

The Value Equation is an equation (kx+ly+mz+..) made up of a standardized, extensible
set of dimensions of value (x, y, z..) along with parameters (k,l,m..) that allow the real time
calculation of relative value created by members. The founders of a Nondominium initially
set the parameters (k,l,m..) to emphasize the dimensions of value they feel are important to
the success of the enterprise, and these may be revised by unanimous decision. One can
visualize the creation of an instance of this equation as choosing the settings of a graphics
equalizer, where you adjust the levels (parameters) associated with each frequency range
(value dimensions) to change how your music sounds (the behaviors that emerge).
Examples of value dimensions include *time, *attention, *participation, *contribution,
*commitment, *accountability, *delivery, *alignment, *expertise, *risk, and *reputation. The
levels of value dimensions can be adjusted to support an organization’s operational reality.
As an example a retail operation might value *time more than an R&D operation, who in
turn may be more results oriented (*contribution). Value dimensions can be dependent on
other value dimensions.

Governance Equation
-------------------

The governance equation is a mechanism to establish heterogeneous fluid governance of
a Nondominium. Governance is fluid in that behaviors and contributions determine
decision making authority in real time. Governance is heterogeneous in that different
methods for determining authority can exist for each decision type identified for the
Nondominium. While there will be standardized decision types available for use, a specific
Nondominium may establish their own. The only required decision type is to establish the
authority to define decision types.
The governance equation is a standardized, extensible set of measurable dimensions of
governance. These dimensions will have considerable if not complete overlap with those
of the Value Equation. A particular Nondominium agreement may use some or all of those
dimensions, and may assign weights to them to incent the emergence of their desired
organizational form. A governance equation apportions decision making rights (authority)
to individuals based on their accrued holdings of the dimensions that make up the
governance equation and the weights assigned to those dimensions in proportion to other
members. An example of democratic decision making could be based solely on
membership. An example that used the value equation to determine voting rights would be
a meritocracy.

Governance is implemented through the identification of decision types, and the
association of a governance equation to each decision type. The primary governance
equation for a decision type determines who has decision making authority. There may be
subordinate governance equations that determine who should be consulted prior to a
decision (must reply), informed of a proposed decision (may reply), or merely informed of
the actual outcome of the decision. Decision types also specify the decision scope,
decision mechanism, decision process, required inputs, voting rules, minimum open time,
available outcomes, monitoring and compliance mechanisms and appropriate sanctions
for non­compliance.

Forking a Nondominium
---------------------

Based on a disagreement, or as a reaction to being excluded, a member or members may
fork the Nondominium and exercise their rights to use and usufruct of the resources in the
old Nondominium in a new Nondominium. The may then exercise Governance rights they
determine with a new Governance Equation and accumulating new reward rights using a
new Value Equation. The new Nondominium may make use of the old Nondominium’s
dimension of Value and Governance account balances to set starting values or may set
them manually by agreement of the founders of the new Nondominium.
Under the terms of the previous Nondominium Agreement that gives them the right to fork,
they also must respect the parent Nondominium’s Value Equation for all contributions prior
to the fork and flow back value through to the old Nondominium based on those
contributions as evaluated by the old Nondominium Agreement. New contributions in the
new Nondominium will be evaluated using the new Value and Governance Equations.
Note that portable rights are to non­rival and low subtractability resources from the old
Nondominium (a fork cannot take rival goods with them) and the fork ports existing rights
the members have to the entire Nondominium, not just the contributions the member has
made to date. For example an entire code base can be brought into the new
Nondominium, not just the lines of code written by the members of the new Nondominium.
Other than the tribute paid to the parent Nondominium for use of the value created there,
this is similar to forking an Open Source project.

Types of Goods
--------------

Understanding goods types is essential for being able to understand the set of property
rights that go with those types and hence the ability to bundle those rights appropriately.
Historically, and persisting to this day there has been an understanding of property as a
dichotomy of public and private. Ostrom and Ostrom have reframed this as a quadrant of
public, private, common pool resources and toll goods. Defining these below will allow a
discussion of the bundling of ownership rights under Nondominium.

Two Types of Goods
------------------

“Pure private goods are both excludable (individual A can be excluded from consuming
private goods unless paid for) and rivalrous (whatever individual A consumes, no one else
can consume). Public goods are both non­excludable and non­rivalrous. “ (Ostrom &
Ostrom describing Samuelson)
Noting there is an implied quadrant made from these two dichotomies, this begs the
question of how to label the other two quadrants (excludable and non­rivalrous (which
Buchanan calls ‘club goods’), and non­excludable and rivalrous).

Four Types of Goods (Ostrom & Ostrom)
------------------------------------

After redefining rivalrous/non­rivalrous as degrees of subtractability between subtractable
and non­subtractable (ie subject to depletion through use or not), Ostrom and Ostrom go on
to propose four types of goods. Public goods (low excludability and low subtractability),
private goods (high excludability and high subtractability), toll goods (high excludability, low
subtractability), and common pool resources (high subtractability, low excludability)

Types of Ownership
------------------

While goods types intersect ownership types they are not identical. Goods types exist
whether or not a property regime does. For example a common pool resource may be
owned as government property, private property, community property of no one at all
(Ostrom quoting Wantrum and Bishop). For example a public good with no one at all
owning it would be consistent with Common Heritage of Mankind (high seas, space,
antarctica) in the Westphalian tradition. The more recent discussions around ‘the
commons’ may fit into a public good or a common pool resource that is owned by a
community or government, or no one at all.

Nondominium and Types of Goods
------------------------------

Nondominium is a new property regime that can be applied to any type of good at the
discretion of the current owner or owner(s) by registering that good in the Nondominium. In
doing so the owner irreversibly transfers ownership of the good into the Nondominium, and
may receive some of the ownership rights back through the operation of the Value and
Governance Equations.
The original use of Chris Cook’s Nondominium was to allow the development of a resource
under disputed ownership, where the issue of ownership was set aside through a
Nondominium agreement so that development could proceed to all parties benefits using
an agreed upon (non­vetoed in his model) revenue sharing method.
Leister and Frazier subsequently extended this to the management of Westphalian
commons (Common Heritage of Mankind) such as the open ocean, antarctica and space.

Ownership and Property Rights
-----------------------------

### Traditional Property Rights

From the wikipedia entry on property, the current rights associated with (private) property
are discussed:
“Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume,
alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy
it, or to exclude others from doing these things,as well as perhaps to abandon it; whereas
regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it
(as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it”.

### Common Pool Resource Property Rights

From Ostrom and Shlager (1992) identified 5 property rights that individuals using a
common pool resource might cumulatively have (noting a bias toward physical resources):
 Access: a right to enter a defined physical property
* Withdrawal: a right to harvest the products of a resource such as timber, water, or
food for pastoral animals
* Management: a right to regulate the use patterns of other harvesters and to
transform a resource system by building improvements
* Exclusion: a right to determine who else will have the right of access to a resource
and whether that right can be transferred
* Alienation: a right to sell or lease any of the above four rights

### Modification of Property Rights under Nondominium

Ownership is conceived as a bundle of rights over a given property. Useful outcomes are
possible by adjusting how these rights are bundled and managed. Nondominium
specifically adjusts the bundle of rights that are available to members using the value
equation and governance equation using the structure of a Custodian who accepts all
rights and redistributes (some of) them. The Custodian in turn is governed by the members
of the Nondominium according to the governance equation.

All property rights are transferred to the Custodian by the members of the Nondominium
through the act of registering a resource or value added into the Nondominium. The
Custodian in return grants the members the right to use, alter/improve (add value), and to
receive “rents” (more generally reward in any form) on the entire resource pool based on
the value the member has contributed to the Nondominium in proportion to other members.

Exclusive use is not returned to the members but managed by the Custodian.
Non­members may be excluded by the Custodian from use of the Nondominium. Members
may be temporarily or permanently excluded from use of the Nondominium as an act of
censure (based on agreed upon sanctions) or may be temporarily excluded from use of a
portion of the Nondominium in the process of apportioning the use of rivalrous goods.
Management (regulation of use) is performed through the fluid governance mechanisms
described below. Temporary exclusive use of a rivalrous good (for example a piece of
equipment) may be subject to tolls expressed in exchange value terms.

Withdrawal (including consumption) of a rivalrous good may be subject to provision of
exchange value or to a system of account where credit balances must revolve. Destruction
of value follows similar logic. Where withdrawal occurs across the boundary of the
Nondominium it must be authorized by the appropriate decision making process. Any
surplus exchange value realized through internal or external withdrawal shall accrue to the
membership through the operation of the Value Equation.

It is worth noting that the rights to ‘keep’ or ‘abandon’ along with ‘exclude’ are the most
problematic of property rights, in particular when applied artificially to non­rivalrous goods
(as done by Intellectual Property Rights). These rights are withdrawn from the system by
the Custodian to encourage use and development of resources in a sustainable way in the
service of human needs, and to discourage hoarding and financialization of assets.

Alienation rights are modified to ensure that the Nondominium is only dissolved
altruistically.

Governance
----------

### Common Pool Resource Governance Best Practices

Poteete, Janssen and Ostrom (2010) list the following design principles for governance of
a commons:
“
1. Well Defined Boundaries: The boundaries of a resource system, as well as the set
of individuals or households with rights to the resource, should be clearly defined.
The clarity of the social boundary influences incentives for cooperation. Clarity of
the boundaries of a resource system limits problems related to externalities. Rule
enforcement becomes easier when both types of boundaries are well defined.

2. Proportional Equivalence between Benefits and Costs: Rules­in­use should allocate
benefits associated with a common­pool resource in proportion to contributions of required
inputs. Rules that respect proportionality are more widely accepted as equitable.
Perceived inequity may lead some participants to refuse to abide by rules they consider to
be unfair.

3. Collective­Choice Arrangements: Most individuals affected by a natural resource
regime should be authorized to participate in making and modifying its rules. This principle
increases the likelihood that rules fit local circumstances, change over time to reflect local
environmental and social dynamics, and are considered fair by participants.
Common­property institutions that empower local elites ­ rather than most local resource
users ­ are likely to generate policies that benefit the elites disproportionately; these
arrangements are not consistent with the second design principle.

4. Monitoring: The individuals charged with monitoring rule adherence and resource
conditions should be accountable to users. Reliable monitoring raises confidence among
users that they can operate without the fear that others are taking advantage of them.
Robust, self­organized resource regimes tend to select their own monitors.

5. Graduated Sanctions: Sanctions for violated rules should be graduated. Graduated
sanctions signal that infractions are noticed while allowing for misunderstandings,
mistakes, and exceptional circumstances that lead to breaking. The encourage individuals
who have broken a rule to resume compliance in order to enjoy ongoing trust.

6. Conflict­Resolution Mechanisms: There should be rapid, low­cost, local arenas to
resolve conflicts among users or between users and officials. Some conflicts arise
because participants interpret in different ways a rule that they have jointly made. Simple,
local mechanisms that get conflicts aired immediately and produce resolutions that are
generally known in the community can limit the number of conflicts that reduce trust

7. Minimal Recognition of Rights: The rights of local users to make their own rules
should be recognized by the national or local government. Resource regimes that lack
official recognition have operated over long periods but have had to rely almost entirely on
unanimity as the rule used to change rules. Otherwise, disgruntled participants who
oppose a rule change can go to the external authorities to threaten the regime itself.
Changing rules using unanimity imposes high transaction costs and prevents a group from
searching for better­matched rules a relatively lower costs.

8. Nested Enterprises: When common­pool resources are part of a larger system,
governance activities should be organized in multiple nested layers. Small­scale units can
match rules to local conditions, but larger­scale institutions are also needed to govern
interdependencies among smaller units. The rules allocating water among major
branches of an irrigation system, for example, may differ from the rules used to allocate
water among farmers along a single distribution channel.”

### Nondominium and the Principles of Governance

1. Well Defined Boundaries: As a Nondominium applies to intangible as well as well
bounded physical resources, boundaries are defined by whether a person has
signed the Nondominium agreement. This is considered an open and largely
permeable boundary, but also very clear regarding membership boundaries.
Resource boundaries are established through a registry where resources are
provided to the Nondominium explicitly. Use value of those resources is made
available to members and the use of rivalrous goods are managed by the
Custodian. Where a resource of the Nondominium is improved the modified
resource is to be registered with the Nondominium. Where an output is created
using the Nondominium that output is to be registered with the Nondominium.

2. Proportional Equivalence between Benefits and Costs: The Value Equation tracks
all dimensions of value and reward flows to members based on their relative
contributions.

3. Collective­Choice Arrangements: The governance equation apportions decision
making authority to members of the Nondominium in a transparent and predictable
way. This ensures those who have a stake in the resource have a say in its use.
There is a concern that parties who have a stake in or are affected by the resource
are not members or may not have added sufficient value to have standing. This is
an ongoing concern.

4. Monitoring: All actions in a Nondominium need to be intermediated by an
information system to be able to capture them and use them in the equations. If
relevant use of assets is not being captured or if value added or outputs created are
not being registered then sanctions will need to apply. These will be determined
through the operation of the governance equation on given decision types.
Monitoring mechanisms will need to be created as needed.

5. Graduated Sanctions: Sanctions will be determined through the operation of the
governance equation.

6. Conflict­Resolution Mechanisms: Mechanisms will be determined through the
operation of the governance equation.

7. Minimal Recognition of Rights: This is an external force, and requires that
Nondomium is a recognized legal form in the jurisdictions it operates in

8. Nested Enterprises: Nondominium is an infinitely nestable structure as
Nondominiums can be members of other Nondominiums. Actual nesting will be left
as an operational choice.

Contrasting Nondominium with Other Forms of Ownership
-----------------------------------------------------

###Nondominium and the Commons

Nondominium is to be viewed in contrast with a Commons, which consist of resources
which are not owned or not ownable, usually abundant but often depletable / subtractable
without governance. They are not excludable or are considered a fundamental human right
so must allow free access. Governance of a commons is a voluntary group process that
ensures it is maintained or enhanced and not destroyed (such as air and water, or
Common Heritage of Mankind (i.e. high seas, antarctica or space).

Nondominium is not open access. It is open access only to members and even then only
when dealing with non­rivalrous goods. Consumption and use of rivalrous goods must be
managed by the Custodian and so cannot be considered open access. Nondominium
may refer to excludable resources, to which access can be practically limited, and which
may or may not be subtractable/abundant.

Nondominium is not the absence of ownership, but rather a refactoring of ownership rights
between the individual member and the Custodian of the Nondominium.

### Nondominium and Cooperative Ownership

Cooperative ownership, based on the Rochdale principles, insists that a cooperative be
governed democratically. Members may allocate surpluses for any or all of the following
purposes: developing their co­operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at
least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the
co­operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership. Members
contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co­operative.
Investors usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition
of membership.
Nondominiums may be a collection of governance modalities, as each decision type within
a Nondominium is associated with a Governance Equation that can be modified to
approximate democracy or meritocracy or any other form. There is no capital requirement
for membership. Capital may only be contributed as use value. Surpluses are distributed
to members per the Value Equation and the notion of retained earnings as described in
cooperatives is replaced by voluntary reinvestment.

### Nondominium and Collective Ownership

Nondominium is to be viewed in contrast with Collective Ownership, where property is
jointly held according to an agreement, which includes member only clubs, and private
property held by groups of individuals or by corporations.
Nondominium ownership is indivisible and non­transferable (except altruistically). There
are no shares that can be redeemed or transferred. There is no fiduciary duty to maximize
shareholder value. When one places property or value into a Nondominium, the member
retains the beneficial ownership (the right to benefit from the value created by the property)
but surrenders exclusive ownership. Ownership rights are not redeemable from the
custodian, as no ‘shares’ are issued in response to property donated or value created
through the operation of productive assets. Use, usufruct and beneficial ownership rights
are distributed to members of the nondominium by the Custodian according to the
agreement.
Nondominium is only excludable based on whether or not a party is willing to sign the
Nondominium Agreement, not on any other basis. In particular no capital requirements
exist for membership.

### Nondominium and For Benefit Corporations

In an article for Harvard Business Review (2011/11) Heerad Sabeti outlines the key
characteristics of for­benefit forms:
“

* Primary Characteristics

    + Embedded Purpose: A commitment to mission is in the organizations DNA.
Fiduciary duty is to purpose.

    + Earned Income: Sales of goods and services generate most of the income

* Secondary Characteristics

    + Inclusive Ownership: Ownership rights are allocated among stakeholders in
accordance with their contributions

    + Stakeholder Governance: Decision rights regarding information and control
are distributed among stakeholder constituencies

    + Fair Compensation: Employees and other stakeholders are compensated in
proportion to their contributions

    + Reasonable Returns: Limitations on investment returns protect the
organization’s ability to achieve its mission

    + Social and Environmental Responsibility: Social and environmental
performance is constantly improved throughout the stakeholder network

    + Transparency: Social, environmental, and financial performance and impact
are fully and accurately assessed and reported

    + Protected assets: social purpose assets are preserved upon dissolution,
conversion, or ownership transfer”

This description of for­benefit is highly aligned with the Nondominium concept. The points
of difference would be in the embedded purpose, where Nondominium does not have
restrictions on what this should be, whereas notions of for­benefit are of it solving a social
ill. If unemployment, underemployment, and lack of workplace engagement are considered
social ills the perhaps the two forms are not so far apart.

On the points of earned income and related reasonable returns, a Nondominium is free to
accept donations or to sell its goods or services, but it is proposed that taking capital in
return for equity or control will be against the interests of the Nondominium. If this is
permitted to skew value equations or governance equations, it subjects the network to the
possibility of capture by financial interests. Debt issued against productive assets (see
Kleiner and Bauwens (2014)) being paid back on an ‘as used’ basis with no interest may
be acceptable. The point here is that extraction of rents by financial capital is to be
disallowed. All returns or surpluses are to be distributed to the membership using the
value equation. The membership or a portion thereof may choose to reinvest this
exchange value in the form of productive assets and this shall be recognized as a further
contribution to the Nondominium as it is used. In such a way financial assets may be used
to provide productive assets and may attract a return for its use value through the normal
operation of the value equation. Whether or not such use value of assets should be a part
of the governance equation is left to an operational Nondominium to decide.
